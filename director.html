            This site summarizes the insights of an observational learning program, conducted by our team of design researchers with the goal of facilitating the beginning of the co-design process by providing teams with contextual understanding of teachers, their practices, classrooms, and students. The framework and teacher modes on this site are the result of 63 one-on-one teacher interviews, 41 classroom observations, and 20 virtual classroom deep dives, conducted with 18 teachers (8 from one district, 7 from a second district, and 3 from a third district) over the 2019-20 school year. We hope that this site helps co-design teams to think about multiple perspectives and engage in further conversation about the classrooms of teachers.

                <h2>Cycle of Practice</h2>
                <p>
                  This summary is organized in a framework called the Cycle of Practice. The Cycle describes one model of the beliefs, knowledge, and actions of teachers in a six stage loop that follows how teacher mindsets and identities come to life in classroom behaviors. This framework is meant to provide co-design teams with insights and discussion prompts to guide their design and development efforts. We hope that co-design teams can use the Cycle framework to consider how prototype learning systems resonate with teacher mindsets and how features can best support teacher practices. For example, a team might brainstorm on a specific stage within the Cycle, digging deep into this aspect of teacher practice to imagine ways that their solution can meet the needs of a range or teachers and reflect the values that they have.

              <h2>Teacher Modes</h2>
              <p>
                We also found four teacher modes in our learnings from our district partners. Each teacher mode embodies a unique approach to the Cycle of Practice. Each teacher mode reveals a different set of teacher beliefs and reveals how these beliefs come to life in classrooms. Each mode is a composite of the teachers collaborated with throughout this learning project, a flexible set of descriptors that are meant to inspire new thinking (not put teachers into categories). We hope that these teacher modes can spark new ideas in the co-design teams and act as filters as teams iterate solutions. For example, teams can ideate functions, features or design attributes for each teacher mode. An exercise like this will help a team to push the edges of their solution, exploring potential barriers to adoption and imagining how the solution will be considered and used by different teachers in different modes. We have included a downloadable resource with some prompting questions at the end of each teacher mode that we hope can support teams in this work.

              <h2>Executive Functions</h2>
              <p>
                It’s worth noting that, though EFs are central to this program, the teachers we interviewed did not discuss EFs by name without prompting. When discussing EFs through our prompts, differences were noted in how teachers discussed EFs and the ways researchers discuss EFs.  This, of course, is the opportunity that this program is addressing.
                <br><br>
                Generally, when asked about EFs, teachers described student emotions, behaviors, and social emotional learning. Teachers discussed working memory in connection to student prior knowledge, recall, muscle memory, and tools such as student notebooks and notes. Teachers discussed cognitive flexibility as related to students’ use of different math strategies or approaches, student ownership of learning, and student problem solving. Inhibitory control was described by teachers through the lens of student behavior, independence, perseverance, self-efficacy, and relationships with peers.
                <br><br>
                Because our goal in this site is to bring forward teacher mindsets and contexts, we use this teacher-driven language throughout.

              <h2>Equity</h2>
              <p>
                Similarly, throughout the site we strive to frame teachers’ equity approaches and practices in their own language and mindsets.
                <br><br>
                Teachers discussed how inequities impact the contexts of their classroom and their students’ lives. Teachers were most likely to talk about challenges related to poverty and said that these could be barriers for learning, for example, if a student was coming in hungry or preoccupied with family stress. They also spoke about how their English language learning students were impacted in their ability to access content; for example, struggles with word problems were a common theme.
                <br><br>
                Some teachers explicitly enacted tools and structures to support equity in their classrooms. The most commonly seen were methods to ensure that calling on students to speak was randomized and evenly distributed. Teachers’ approaches to small group and individual work also emphasized students who most needed the additional support based on their current performance.
                <br><br>
                We hope this document serves as a starting point to further discussions among co-design teams about how equity can inform classroom practices.

                  Finally, this program and the classrooms studied were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are additional insights revealing how the Cycle of Practice was impacted by remote learning. We interviewed teachers at the beginning of Summer 2020 about their experiences from the mid-March closure through the end of the school year. These interviews all took place before teachers were preparing for the 2020-21 school year.

            This observational learning program was conducted by our team of design researchers to provide insight into the contexts of math classrooms and the mindsets and behaviors of teachers.
            <br><br>
            Design research is a generative approach to learning about what the world looks like through the eyes of users. It’s focused on setting aside preconceptions so that we can listen closely, look anew, and gain empathy. Design research surfaces insights about what people value, aspire to, and perceive, as well as what they experience, are challenged by, and need. Its goal is to identify actionable insights and opportunities for design.

              The program was disrupted, as so many things, by the COVID-19 pandemic, so methods shifted midway. Teachers were asked to participate in individual interviews and either classroom observations or lesson deep dives.
              <br><br>
              For the teachers that we visited in person, we conducted our interviews in person, in their classrooms, perched in kid-sized chairs. We observed their classes directly, as well as their team meetings, and interviewed the math leaders in their schools.
              <br><br>
              For the teachers we met after the pandemic set in, we met virtually. Interviews were conducted by video conference and in lieu of classroom observations, we conducted lesson deep dives, in which teachers replayed a lesson for us.

              Interviews were shaped around the following topics (across either two (pandemic) or three (pre-pandemic) interviews). The goal of the interviews was to understand teachers’ perspectives, experiences, and contexts to provide opportunities for the R&D teams to co-design solutions that reflect these values, needs, and realities.
              <br><br>
              Our team designed our interview topics around a model developed to apply research on behavior change to design opportunities. This model was developed based on a review of literature around adherence and behavior change in the psychology, medicine, and nursing practices, including influential work such as the research of James Prochaska and Robin DiMatteo. These findings from academic research were combined with best practices from designers working in the behavior change space to create a set of tools that are both theoretically rigorous and also useful, usable, and desirable for the practice of designing interventions.

              To ground the observations in sound math instruction, our team was normed on key practices (a crosswalk of NCTM Principles to Action (2014) and Teaching for Robust Understanding (Schoenfeld, 2014)). Our goal was not to evaluate teachers, but to center our observations on barriers and enablers of critical practices.
              <br><br>
              Classroom observations were shaped around a common design thinking framework, in which the design researchers observed for the following areas. This framework allows design researchers to focus attention on critical elements of the context, with the goal of identifying design opportunities.

              Lesson deep dives in the virtual setting were not able to replicate the experience of being in classrooms as learning was happening, but we sought to investigate the areas of highest relevance, based on analysis of the direct observations. We asked teachers to pick one pre-pandemic lesson for each deep dive and to walk us through the lesson as it rolled out.

            <p class="small-12 cell">
              Our team worked in pairs to interview and observe teachers and coded this data (interview notes, video and audio recordings) as teams. Designers coded the data for areas of interest independently and then met to align on any areas of disagreement (there were few). Group analysis surfaced themes within and across these initial areas of interest, which became the key factors highlighted in the final site.
              <br><br>
              We returned to the model of adherence and behavior change to structure our analysis, aligning key factors to the stages of this model to create the Cycle of Practice framework.
              <br><br>
              To bring this framework to life and to contextualize how it unfurls for different types of teachers, we then analyzed participants to identify clusters of beliefs and practices. Key factors were articulated for each of the teachers who we learned from. For factors drawn from teachers’ self-reporting, the team ranked teachers high/medium/low against a common rubric so that trends could be identified. For factors related to observable behaviors, these were coded for each participant. The team worked together to look across factors, across participants, identifying teacher modes that interacted with the framework in distinct ways.

              <p>
                When teachers are in Director mode, they are conceptually grounded in their teaching, with an emphasis on making connections between math content and the real world. They are excited to explore a range of ways to communicate information and to share math ideas with their students.
                <br><br>
                In Director mode, teachers focus on each individual student’s growth and learning in the classroom. They seek to create ways for every student to connect to the math content, looking for different channels and methods that can engage all the types of learners in their room. They toggle between videos, readings, manipulatives, hands-on projects, and other means so that each student has channels that work for them in different situations.
                <br><br>
                Being in Director mode means teachers are focusing on the application of math concepts. For teachers in Director mode, the value of math is that it is woven into our lives every day, and they want their students to see this as well. If they are successful in grounding students in math concepts, teachers in Director mode empower students for life. They like word problems, real world examples, and applied projects to demonstrate these connections between math and students’ contexts.
                <br><br>
                In Director mode, teachers believe in the importance of social emotional learning, but they treat this as separate from math learning. They tend to their students’ behaviors and social emotional needs and growth; they just do this separate from math.

                  Meet Mr. Jaime Hernandez, a teacher who is often in Director mode. Mr. Hernandez believes that it’s important that each of his students find a way to connect to the math he teaches, so he makes an effort to present information in a lot of different ways. He uses things like engaging videos, examples that help them see how the math works in their life, and math stations to get students excited about math.
                  <br><br>
                  The hardest part of his job is the interpersonal drama. But once kids can put aside their social emotional challenges and get to the work, he and his class have a great time learning math together. Of course, it’s important that kids learn to manage their social emotional challenges, but in math class it can get in the way of the academics.

                They have an individualistic view of learning, emphasizing the needs of each individual student (or their level of learning) and seeking to make math accessible to each of them through different methods or learning channels.

                    <span class="is-bold">Independence: </span>
                    While in Director mode, teachers want their students to become self-sufficient in the classroom, seeing this as an opportunity to build confidence and learn to advocate for themselves -- skills they will need in life. They see this independence in how students approach the work, in their ability to work on their own, manage their own needs for supplies, and identify resources that can help them.

                  <li>
                    <span class="is-bold">Math-related: </span>
                    Teachers in Director mode want their students to have a better developed sense of their personal capacity for math, to believe that there is no such thing as a “math person” and a “non-math person.” They approach this individually, wanting each student to have a toolkit of strategies and approaches so they have options when they address a problem.

                  <li>
                    <span class="is-bold">Life readiness: </span>
                    Because teachers are focused on math while in Director mode, they hold life readiness goals less strongly. When present, life readiness appears in how math relates to real world scenarios, like finances.

                    Mr. Hernandez’s mental model of teaching and learning is about math’s connection to the real world. He wants students to see math in the everyday, from sharing a pizza to figuring how much paint they’ll need to paint their family’s kitchen. And, because every student learns differently, he wants them each to have a toolbox of strategies that they can use to solve these problems.

                      With Director mode’s emphasis on the different student ways of working and needs of their students, technology can be a way for teachers in this mode to differentiate and engage. While in Director mode, some teachers offer a palette of digital options so that students can find the channels (e.g., videos, guided practice) that work best for them. Others value digital platforms because they can adjust to the specific performance of each student.

                      Mr. Hernandez is a bit stressed. His class is off-pace because his kids had a hard time with last week’s content. He’s trying to figure out what part of this week he can trim or combine so that he can get them caught up. He’s looking through the curriculum resources, reading back through notes from his coach, and going to his go-to online sources for inspiration.

                    Teachers in Director mode seek to create focused environments where students can learn in the ways that match their preferred ways of working.

                    Their classroom contexts are designed to support the individual; while students often work together, the collaboration may be more surface level, without the scaffolding to enable students to co-construct knowledge or make connections across their thinking.
                    <br><br>
                    These teachers seek to apply math to the real world. Class projects focus on work that connects math skills and concepts to their lives and contexts. Word problems are viewed as meaningful for the opportunity to put math into life applications.
                    <br><br>
                    While in Director mode, teachers can be deterred by behavioral distractions. While they believe that social emotional skills are important for their students, they treat these as separate from math learning, addressed at other times in the day or through the opportunity for socialization or parallel work. They often have strategies for how to help a student to equilibrate so that they may return to doing math, but not for how challenging math work can develop this skill for students.

                        Teachers in Director mode use whole class configurations to instruct and to integrate student voice.

Small group and partner work are used interchangeably, with the goal of productive math discussions not fully realized because of limited scaffolding by teachers. Individual work is used for fluency work and as an opportunity for teachers to assess student work.

It’s getting close to the end of the school year, testing is behind them, so they can have more fun with math projects that really connect what they’ve learned.

They are often thinking about where to trim and how to edit so that they can reach their goals. When teachers are in this mode, it feels like too much content, not enough time.

                        Teachers in Director mode want to tend to their students’ social emotional needs, but these can get in the way of their math teaching and learning. Behavioral issues or student “drama” can throw a whole lesson off. Teachers who often find themselves in this mode are accustomed to setting the class to an activity to fill time so that they can help an individual student get back to balance.

                        In this mode, teachers are open to trying new things, but they can have a tough time rolling with the inevitable stumbles of a new lesson or activity. When something doesn’t go as planned, they have to step back that evening and reset the following day; often without much new insight into how to improve either their students’ understanding or their own approach.

                          In Director mode, teachers seek opportunities to elevate student voice, creating spaces for students to “own” the room. In these situations, however, interactions are still mediated by the teacher, who drives questioning or directs the presentation.

                          While in Director mode, teachers spend time building up students to feel confident in their abilities and pushing them to persevere, reinforcing for students that challenges push their brains to work even better. In moments of student stress or behavioral outbursts, teachers in Director mode redirect students to help them return to a balanced state.

                          <span class="is-bold">Student → teacher </span><br>
                          While teachers in this mode may strive for greater student independence, they are responsive to student-initiated interactions and often swoop in to help a student navigate an answer.

                          When in Director mode, teachers believe in rich student-to-student interactions though intentionally creating the environment for these interactions to flourish is not always a priority.

                          While in Director mode, teachers are individualistic in their motivation. They like to celebrate student effort and performance, often with extrinsic motivators that reward basic participation; for example, this might mean a small candy or snack for doing classwork. Individual behaviors and performance are called out, for example, through Class Dojo points or with congratulatory posters recognizing students who performed well on a recent test.

                            Mr. Hernandez is asking students to do a group project. As noise levels rise, Mr. Hernandez can tell that it’s not math discussion happening. He circulates the room, going to each group that seems like they are not on task to encourage them to reorient back to the math practice at hand. By the time he gets one group settled down, another is getting feisty again.

                            Students are gathered around a poster in the hallway. Mr. Hernandez has posted the results from the last big test and everyone who got better than 80% is on the list. Mr. Hernandez stands at the doorway and is glad to see the class so excited; he high fives students on their way in. For those who didn’t make the poster, he tells them this is an opportunity to set a goal for themself to make the list next time.

                        In Director mode, teachers use a range of feedback inputs to see how each student is performing so that they can adjust their teaching accordingly.

                        Teachers in Director mode are looking at individual student performance and growth. They celebrate math improvement and also appreciate changes to attitude or work ethic, though these are often framed as something that “clicked in,” without the teacher recognizing their own contribution to this shift.

                          In this mode, teachers may use frequent exit tickets, review of student work and process, and observations of their speed and number of attempts to gauge whether students are ready to move on. They have a mental cut-off as a marker of whether they can keep progressing or need to reteach. Feedback helps them consider how they can adjust for the next year, thinking about where they can go faster and where students took longer than anticipated.

He collects their exit tickets and quickly flips through them, sorting them as he goes. Great. His mental line is 70%: if more than that got the answer right, he’s good to move on with the class. Today only a couple kids got the answer wrong. He’ll pull them for a minute after lunch to support them in thinking through how to get to the right answer.
