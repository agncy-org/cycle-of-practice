            This site summarizes the insights of an observational learning program, conducted by our team of design researchers with the goal of facilitating the beginning of the co-design process by providing teams with contextual understanding of teachers, their practices, classrooms, and students. The framework and teacher modes on this site are the result of 63 one-on-one teacher interviews, 41 classroom observations, and 20 virtual classroom deep dives, conducted with 18 teachers (8 from one district, 7 from a second district, and 3 from a third district) over the 2019-20 school year. We hope that this site helps co-design teams to think about multiple perspectives and engage in further conversation about the classrooms of teachers.

                <h2>Cycle of Practice</h2>
                <p>
                  This summary is organized in a framework called the Cycle of Practice. The Cycle describes one model of the beliefs, knowledge, and actions of teachers in a six stage loop that follows how teacher mindsets and identities come to life in classroom behaviors. This framework is meant to provide co-design teams with insights and discussion prompts to guide their design and development efforts. We hope that co-design teams can use the Cycle framework to consider how prototype learning systems resonate with teacher mindsets and how features can best support teacher practices. For example, a team might brainstorm on a specific stage within the Cycle, digging deep into this aspect of teacher practice to imagine ways that their solution can meet the needs of a range or teachers and reflect the values that they have.

              <h2>Teacher Modes</h2>
              <p>
                We also found four teacher modes in our learnings from our district partners. Each teacher mode embodies a unique approach to the Cycle of Practice. Each teacher mode reveals a different set of teacher beliefs and reveals how these beliefs come to life in classrooms. Each mode is a composite of the teachers collaborated with throughout this learning project, a flexible set of descriptors that are meant to inspire new thinking (not put teachers into categories). We hope that these teacher modes can spark new ideas in the co-design teams and act as filters as teams iterate solutions. For example, teams can ideate functions, features or design attributes for each teacher mode. An exercise like this will help a team to push the edges of their solution, exploring potential barriers to adoption and imagining how the solution will be considered and used by different teachers in different modes. We have included a downloadable resource with some prompting questions at the end of each teacher mode that we hope can support teams in this work.

              <h2>Executive Functions</h2>
              <p>
                It’s worth noting that, though EFs are central to this program, the teachers we interviewed did not discuss EFs by name without prompting. When discussing EFs through our prompts, differences were noted in how teachers discussed EFs and the ways researchers discuss EFs.  This, of course, is the opportunity that this program is addressing.
                <br><br>
                Generally, when asked about EFs, teachers described student emotions, behaviors, and social emotional learning. Teachers discussed working memory in connection to student prior knowledge, recall, muscle memory, and tools such as student notebooks and notes. Teachers discussed cognitive flexibility as related to students’ use of different math strategies or approaches, student ownership of learning, and student problem solving. Inhibitory control was described by teachers through the lens of student behavior, independence, perseverance, self-efficacy, and relationships with peers.
                <br><br>
                Because our goal in this site is to bring forward teacher mindsets and contexts, we use this teacher-driven language throughout.

              <h2>Equity</h2>
              <p>
                Similarly, throughout the site we strive to frame teachers’ equity approaches and practices in their own language and mindsets.
                <br><br>
                Teachers discussed how inequities impact the contexts of their classroom and their students’ lives. Teachers were most likely to talk about challenges related to poverty and said that these could be barriers for learning, for example, if a student was coming in hungry or preoccupied with family stress. They also spoke about how their English language learning students were impacted in their ability to access content; for example, struggles with word problems were a common theme.
                <br><br>
                Some teachers explicitly enacted tools and structures to support equity in their classrooms. The most commonly seen were methods to ensure that calling on students to speak was randomized and evenly distributed. Teachers’ approaches to small group and individual work also emphasized students who most needed the additional support based on their current performance.
                <br><br>
                We hope this document serves as a starting point to further discussions among co-design teams about how equity can inform classroom practices.

                  Finally, this program and the classrooms studied were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are additional insights revealing how the Cycle of Practice was impacted by remote learning. We interviewed teachers at the beginning of Summer 2020 about their experiences from the mid-March closure through the end of the school year. These interviews all took place before teachers were preparing for the 2020-21 school year.

            This observational learning program was conducted by our team of design researchers to provide insight into the contexts of math classrooms and the mindsets and behaviors of teachers.
            <br><br>
            Design research is a generative approach to learning about what the world looks like through the eyes of users. It’s focused on setting aside preconceptions so that we can listen closely, look anew, and gain empathy. Design research surfaces insights about what people value, aspire to, and perceive, as well as what they experience, are challenged by, and need. Its goal is to identify actionable insights and opportunities for design.

              The program was disrupted, as so many things, by the COVID-19 pandemic, so methods shifted midway. Teachers were asked to participate in individual interviews and either classroom observations or lesson deep dives.
              <br><br>
              For the teachers that we visited in person, we conducted our interviews in person, in their classrooms, perched in kid-sized chairs. We observed their classes directly, as well as their team meetings, and interviewed the math leaders in their schools.
              <br><br>
              For the teachers we met after the pandemic set in, we met virtually. Interviews were conducted by video conference and in lieu of classroom observations, we conducted lesson deep dives, in which teachers replayed a lesson for us.

              Interviews were shaped around the following topics (across either two (pandemic) or three (pre-pandemic) interviews). The goal of the interviews was to understand teachers’ perspectives, experiences, and contexts to provide opportunities for the R&D teams to co-design solutions that reflect these values, needs, and realities.
              <br><br>
              Our team designed our interview topics around a model developed to apply research on behavior change to design opportunities. This model was developed based on a review of literature around adherence and behavior change in the psychology, medicine, and nursing practices, including influential work such as the research of James Prochaska and Robin DiMatteo. These findings from academic research were combined with best practices from designers working in the behavior change space to create a set of tools that are both theoretically rigorous and also useful, usable, and desirable for the practice of designing interventions.

              To ground the observations in sound math instruction, our team was normed on key practices (a crosswalk of NCTM Principles to Action (2014) and Teaching for Robust Understanding (Schoenfeld, 2014)). Our goal was not to evaluate teachers, but to center our observations on barriers and enablers of critical practices.
              <br><br>
              Classroom observations were shaped around a common design thinking framework, in which the design researchers observed for the following areas. This framework allows design researchers to focus attention on critical elements of the context, with the goal of identifying design opportunities.

              Lesson deep dives in the virtual setting were not able to replicate the experience of being in classrooms as learning was happening, but we sought to investigate the areas of highest relevance, based on analysis of the direct observations. We asked teachers to pick one pre-pandemic lesson for each deep dive and to walk us through the lesson as it rolled out.

              Our team worked in pairs to interview and observe teachers and coded this data (interview notes, video and audio recordings) as teams. Designers coded the data for areas of interest independently and then met to align on any areas of disagreement (there were few). Group analysis surfaced themes within and across these initial areas of interest, which became the key factors highlighted in the final site.
              <br><br>
              We returned to the model of adherence and behavior change to structure our analysis, aligning key factors to the stages of this model to create the Cycle of Practice framework.
              <br><br>
              To bring this framework to life and to contextualize how it unfurls for different types of teachers, we then analyzed participants to identify clusters of beliefs and practices. Key factors were articulated for each of the teachers who we learned from. For factors drawn from teachers’ self-reporting, the team ranked teachers high/medium/low against a common rubric so that trends could be identified. For factors related to observable behaviors, these were coded for each participant. The team worked together to look across factors, across participants, identifying teacher modes that interacted with the framework in distinct ways.

              <p>
                When they’re in Catalyst mode, teachers approach math as fully integrated with their students’ lives and social emotional skills. They teach math with an emphasis on conceptual understanding, seeking to develop this through communal experiences and dialogue.
                <br><br>
                In this mode, teachers ask students to develop their own perspectives on math challenges and to work with their peers to wrestle with these together. These teachers put considerable energy and attention into building the culture of the classroom so that this type of learning structure is feasible.
                <br><br>
                Teachers in this mode also believe that learning math in this way develops skills that will help their students more broadly in life: the ability to sit with a hard problem, to navigate differences with peers, to have a respectful conversation even when you disagree. While in Catalyst mode, teachers believe that learning math in this manner teaches math in ways that are more extensible for students while helping them build critical life skills.

                  Meet Ms. Adele Greene, a teacher who often finds herself in Catalyst mode. Ms. Greene says she is a role model for the students in her class, demonstrating for them both how to learn and how to live. She says her job is not just to teach them the content, but to get them ready for the real world.
                  <br><br>
                  In Ms. Greene’s class, students learn math by exploring it together, constructing their knowledge of a concept as a community. Ms. Greene thinks that when students learn this way, they learn the skills needed to navigate life.

              <p>
                Teachers in this mode have strong beliefs because they see math as relevant to life -- not only math skills, but the competencies that are developed by learning math in challenging, collaborative, conceptual ways.

                    In Catalyst mode, teachers have an asset-rich view of their students and believe they have the capacity to do hard things on their own. They want their students to be able to work and accept challenges independently, with a sense of resourcefulness. This doesn’t leave them hanging -- advocacy and the ability to seek help is seen as part of how teachers in Catalyst mode view students’ independence.

These teachers are clear about the challenges that their students face because of their life contexts and see their way of math teaching as a means towards broader skills and mindsets that will help their students to thrive. They want their students to have options, the benefit of choices.

                      The values have to be significant for the kids. It’s cool to have individual values and beliefs, but what we adults believe now is taken from somewhere, some prior person, belief, or experience.

                  In Ms. Greene’s mental model of learning, the students and the teacher work together as a community, with the teacher creating the context for students to take risks, work together, and make discoveries. Students are learning math and are also learning skills important for life (such as how to disagree with someone or how to sit with a problem) at the same time.

                The teachers interviewed for this program who were in Catalyst mode all have strong curriculum materials provided by their districts that reflect (or guide) the teachers’ approach to connecting multiple strategies and representations. Teaming structures give them trusted thinking and planning partners. Teachers in this mode are comfortable tweaking provided materials to reflect what they know about their students and where they’re at. They are actively engaged in planning and adjusting, harnessing resources to work best for their class.

End-of-unit assessments clarify where they need to get to and they plan backwards from this point to determine the standards to focus on each week or lesson. They work with their team to stay aligned on pacing and to break down focus standards together.
                  <br><br>
                  As teachers in Catalyst mode plan, they integrate what they know about their students and their classroom community. They anticipate where students may struggle, questions they may have, and potential misconceptions. They consider personal interests and learning preferences, reworking curriculum materials to be better tuned for their students. They consider the energy of the room and where it may lag.

                <p>
                  Ms. Greene is planning for the coming week. She knows the curriculum well at this point, so as she sits with each lesson, she’s got a good sense of how to prioritize and where to spend a bit more time. As she drills into Tuesday’s lesson, she keeps her kids in mind. She draws out the models and thinks through how she’ll use colors when she does this on the whiteboard. She reads the word problems and makes edits where she can tell the language will trip kids up and get in the way of the math. She also changes some of the details — her kids won’t care about dividing bushels of apples!

                Teachers in this mode are intentional about how they create structures for learning, committing time to development of community climate and individual social emotional skills and setting clear expectations for classroom culture, rules, and behaviors. With an emphasis on dialogue and collaboration, teachers in Catalyst mode put clear scaffolds in place for students to work together, teaching students the skills of discourse and providing tools such as group roles or conversation sentence structures.

                    <strong>When prompts</strong>

                    <strong>How prompts</strong>

                    Teachers in Catalyst mode have classrooms that show a strong emphasis on collaborative whole class as a learning configuration. For these teachers, whole class configuration is dynamic and interactive, with the goal of student participation, ownership of the work, and collective discovery of connections.
                    <br><br>
                    Whole class is interspersed with individual and partner/small group work, with each of these configurations structured to build towards productive conversation. Teachers in this mode first have students approach a problem individually to struggle with the content and to develop their point of view. They then move into partner or table group conversation to share strategies before being brought back into whole class to compare across groups and build connections.

                        I just love having partner talks. I don’t do as much as the group projects, but group conversations have really really been helpful in the learning. It’s not just about having opportunities to talk; it’s about having structured opportunities to talk. They know: one person talks, then the other. If you’re not on topic, you’re not doing what I asked. There’s a difference between productive talk and unproductive talk. I prefer collaborative learning situations. If I could, I would do most if not all of my teaching that way.

                      Ms. Greene is playing Bud Powell’s music in the room today; jazz is about making and playing with patterns like math is. As students file in from recess, she’s standing at the door to say hello to each one and to get a sense of their energy. The students don’t need much guidance, they know the routine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The classroom is buzzing with noise, as students huddle over their tables, walking through a problem. Ms. Greene is circling the room, watching the groups work and listening in. In each group, one of the students is drawing and writing on a whiteboard, while others direct them. As the chatter rises, Ms. Greene interrupts, calling on students to sit down. She names the three groups that will share and tells them which group will go first, second, and last.

                      When the first group goes to the front of the room, they know who will present and who will write their work on the board. As each group shares, Ms. Greene focuses questions on the process and why students approached the problem in this way. She doesn’t confirm what the answer is until each group has shared and the class has talked through the differences between the groups’ work.

                    Just as teachers in Catalyst mode strive to make their students feel comfortable with failure, they see their own adaptations as a way to honor the community by creating a responsive environment. They adapt class-to-class, baking in what has happened the day prior into their plan for the day. And they adapt in the moment, responding to the needs and energy of individuals, groups, and the whole class.
                    <br><br>
                    Teachers in this mode are tuned into their students and are able to anticipate where adjustments may be needed in the moment. They have a sense of who may need a behavioral cue, or where to look (both problems and students) for misconceptions. Finally, they have a repertoire of responses and adaptations, from the need for a total class reset to the need to nudge a group to the ability to support students who are struggling.

                      Teachers in Catalyst mode use both intrinsic and extrinsic means of motivation. Their personal relationships with students are seen as their most powerful lever for intrinsic motivation, offering the ability to support individual goals and behaviors that are resonant to the student.
                      <br><br>
                      Teachers in this mode have extrinsic rewards systems that tend to be both community-oriented and/or long-term. For example, a system may pool student points towards a class pizza party. Or individual points may accrue to allow students to “buy” a prize when they have saved enough.

                        Ms. Greene is working with a pair of students and hears a group across the room that seems to be off-topic. “I don’t think that’s about math!” she says. The students exclaim, “how can you hear us from over there?!”

                        The energy in the class feels “off” and none of the lesson components have worked as planned. Students seem unfocused and conversation is flagging. Ms. Greene tells the class to stand up. They take a brisk walk around the school building to get their wiggles out and their energy up. When they come back, they’re reset and ready to try again.

                      Teachers in Catalyst mode use a range of assessments (formal, student self-report, their own intuitive proof points) to understand where their students are. They see this feedback as a tool for both students and teachers to assess learning and to guide what comes next.
                      <br><br>
                      While in Catalyst mode, teachers are also prone to self-assessment, turning to frequent reflection and student assessments for insight on their own work.

                          We’re data driven, that’s cool, but let’s look at attendance, satisfaction from students, relationship data. Relationships are something people don’t know how to do, I gather the qualitative data by asking how my students are doing. When you’re talking about the human element, that’s not a thing, that’s a person with moving parts all the time.

                      As they wrap up the day’s math lesson, Ms. Greene asks students to give her one, two, three or four fingers to show her their level of understanding. She notices where a student’s confidence or enthusiasm may not match the work they were doing. A four finger self-report with work that’s still lagging is a great foundation to build on; it means she’s got a student excited and ready to work on the concept.
