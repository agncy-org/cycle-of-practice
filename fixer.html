            This site summarizes the insights of an observational learning program, conducted by our team of design researchers with the goal of facilitating the beginning of the co-design process by providing teams with contextual understanding of teachers, their practices, classrooms, and students. The framework and teacher modes on this site are the result of 63 one-on-one teacher interviews, 41 classroom observations, and 20 virtual classroom deep dives, conducted with 18 teachers (8 from one district, 7 from a second district, and 3 from a third district) over the 2019-20 school year. We hope that this site helps co-design teams to think about multiple perspectives and engage in further conversation about the classrooms of teachers.

                <h2>Cycle of Practice</h2>
                <p>
                  This summary is organized in a framework called the Cycle of Practice. The Cycle describes one model of the beliefs, knowledge, and actions of teachers in a six stage loop that follows how teacher mindsets and identities come to life in classroom behaviors. This framework is meant to provide co-design teams with insights and discussion prompts to guide their design and development efforts. We hope that co-design teams can use the Cycle framework to consider how prototype learning systems resonate with teacher mindsets and how features can best support teacher practices. For example, a team might brainstorm on a specific stage within the Cycle, digging deep into this aspect of teacher practice to imagine ways that their solution can meet the needs of a range or teachers and reflect the values that they have.

              <h2>Teacher Modes</h2>
              <p>
                We also found four teacher modes in our learnings from our district partners. Each teacher mode embodies a unique approach to the Cycle of Practice. Each teacher mode reveals a different set of teacher beliefs and reveals how these beliefs come to life in classrooms. Each mode is a composite of the teachers collaborated with throughout this learning project, a flexible set of descriptors that are meant to inspire new thinking (not put teachers into categories). We hope that these teacher modes can spark new ideas in the co-design teams and act as filters as teams iterate solutions. For example, teams can ideate functions, features or design attributes for each teacher mode. An exercise like this will help a team to push the edges of their solution, exploring potential barriers to adoption and imagining how the solution will be considered and used by different teachers in different modes. We have included a downloadable resource with some prompting questions at the end of each teacher mode that we hope can support teams in this work.

              <h2>Executive Functions</h2>
              <p>
                It’s worth noting that, though EFs are central to this program, the teachers we interviewed did not discuss EFs by name without prompting. When discussing EFs through our prompts, differences were noted in how teachers discussed EFs and the ways researchers discuss EFs.  This, of course, is the opportunity that this program is addressing.
                <br><br>
                Generally, when asked about EFs, teachers described student emotions, behaviors, and social emotional learning. Teachers discussed working memory in connection to student prior knowledge, recall, muscle memory, and tools such as student notebooks and notes. Teachers discussed cognitive flexibility as related to students’ use of different math strategies or approaches, student ownership of learning, and student problem solving. Inhibitory control was described by teachers through the lens of student behavior, independence, perseverance, self-efficacy, and relationships with peers.
                <br><br>
                Because our goal in this site is to bring forward teacher mindsets and contexts, we use this teacher-driven language throughout.

              <h2>Equity</h2>
              <p>
                Similarly, throughout the site we strive to frame teachers’ equity approaches and practices in their own language and mindsets.
                <br><br>
                Teachers discussed how inequities impact the contexts of their classroom and their students’ lives. Teachers were most likely to talk about challenges related to poverty and said that these could be barriers for learning, for example, if a student was coming in hungry or preoccupied with family stress. They also spoke about how their English language learning students were impacted in their ability to access content; for example, struggles with word problems were a common theme.
                <br><br>
                Some teachers explicitly enacted tools and structures to support equity in their classrooms. The most commonly seen were methods to ensure that calling on students to speak was randomized and evenly distributed. Teachers’ approaches to small group and individual work also emphasized students who most needed the additional support based on their current performance.
                <br><br>
                We hope this document serves as a starting point to further discussions among co-design teams about how equity can inform classroom practices.

                  Finally, this program and the classrooms studied were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are additional insights revealing how the Cycle of Practice was impacted by remote learning. We interviewed teachers at the beginning of Summer 2020 about their experiences from the mid-March closure through the end of the school year. These interviews all took place before teachers were preparing for the 2020-21 school year.

            This observational learning program was conducted by our team of design researchers to provide insight into the contexts of math classrooms and the mindsets and behaviors of teachers.
            <br><br>
            Design research is a generative approach to learning about what the world looks like through the eyes of users. It’s focused on setting aside preconceptions so that we can listen closely, look anew, and gain empathy. Design research surfaces insights about what people value, aspire to, and perceive, as well as what they experience, are challenged by, and need. Its goal is to identify actionable insights and opportunities for design.

              For the teachers that we visited in person, we conducted our interviews in person, in their classrooms, perched in kid-sized chairs. We observed their classes directly, as well as their team meetings, and interviewed the math leaders in their schools.
              <br><br>
              For the teachers we met after the pandemic set in, we met virtually. Interviews were conducted by video conference and in lieu of classroom observations, we conducted lesson deep dives, in which teachers replayed a lesson for us.

              Interviews were shaped around the following topics (across either two (pandemic) or three (pre-pandemic) interviews). The goal of the interviews was to understand teachers’ perspectives, experiences, and contexts to provide opportunities for the R&D teams to co-design solutions that reflect these values, needs, and realities.
              <br><br>
              Our team designed our interview topics around a model developed to apply research on behavior change to design opportunities. This model was developed based on a review of literature around adherence and behavior change in the psychology, medicine, and nursing practices, including influential work such as the research of James Prochaska and Robin DiMatteo. These findings from academic research were combined with best practices from designers working in the behavior change space to create a set of tools that are both theoretically rigorous and also useful, usable, and desirable for the practice of designing interventions.

              To ground the observations in sound math instruction, our team was normed on key practices (a crosswalk of NCTM Principles to Action (2014) and Teaching for Robust Understanding (Schoenfeld, 2014)). Our goal was not to evaluate teachers, but to center our observations on barriers and enablers of critical practices.
              <br><br>
              Classroom observations were shaped around a common design thinking framework, in which the design researchers observed for the following areas. This framework allows design researchers to focus attention on critical elements of the context, with the goal of identifying design opportunities.

              Lesson deep dives in the virtual setting were not able to replicate the experience of being in classrooms as learning was happening, but we sought to investigate the areas of highest relevance, based on analysis of the direct observations. We asked teachers to pick one pre-pandemic lesson for each deep dive and to walk us through the lesson as it rolled out.

            <p class="small-12 cell">
              Our team worked in pairs to interview and observe teachers and coded this data (interview notes, video and audio recordings) as teams. Designers coded the data for areas of interest independently and then met to align on any areas of disagreement (there were few). Group analysis surfaced themes within and across these initial areas of interest, which became the key factors highlighted in the final site.
              <br><br>
              We returned to the model of adherence and behavior change to structure our analysis, aligning key factors to the stages of this model to create the Cycle of Practice framework.
              <br><br>
              To bring this framework to life and to contextualize how it unfurls for different types of teachers, we then analyzed participants to identify clusters of beliefs and practices. Key factors were articulated for each of the teachers who we learned from. For factors drawn from teachers’ self-reporting, the team ranked teachers high/medium/low against a common rubric so that trends could be identified. For factors related to observable behaviors, these were coded for each participant. The team worked together to look across factors, across participants, identifying teacher modes that interacted with the framework in distinct ways.

              <p>
                “Fixer” is a mode of teaching where the educator holds the weight of the classroom on their shoulders. They feel their students’ life challenges directly and look to create classrooms and relationships that allow them to lift their students up.
                <br><br>
                When in Fixer mode, teachers see math as an opportunity to demonstrate their impact. It’s an arena in which they can manage their students’ experiences, setting them up for success and showing them tricks to master the content. They have a hard time seeing their students struggle and often scaffold them heavily to get them to the right answer. While Fixers may articulate a belief in teaching for conceptual understanding, they often emphasize procedural fluency in their classroom. They believe that mastering the procedure needs to come first for their students.
                <br><br>
                Teachers in Fixer mode often focus on their students’ life contexts and the challenges that may be present. They want to alleviate these with nurturing and care and to build students up through their one-on-one relationships.

                  <br><br>
                  Ms. Delacruz wants her class to work hard at math and to feel they’re successful. It’s important for her kids to know they can do better in life, so she gives them lots of tips and fun tricks for getting the math down pat. She tries to make class a little bit of joy in their lives; when they sing and clap in class, they’re not only learning, but also lifting their hearts.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Independence:</strong>
                    Fixer mode scores the lowest of all teacher modes for student independence goals. Because they see their support as the essential foundation for student development, student independence is not front and center in their mindset.

                When a teacher adopts a Fixer mental model of teaching and learning, it centers heavily on the teacher.
              </h6>
              <p>
                When teachers are in Fixer mode, they believe that student learning relies on their guidance and encouragement. Fixers’ desire to support their students results in a heavily scaffolded experience, as teachers push their students towards both academic and behavioral progress with clearly articulated goals and dictated actions. They see fluency coming before conceptual understanding, which can mean that conceptual work is punted...and sometimes never reached because of time constraints.

                  In Fixer mode, the roles that teachers have for themselves emphasize their personal connections with students to alleviate students’ life experiences.

                    <strong>Build climate:</strong>
                    While in Fixer mode, teachers place less emphasis on building classroom culture because their focus is on their one-to-one relationships with students.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Make connections:</strong>
                    Making connections with students is critical in Fixer mode. Teachers in this mode seek to boost student confidence, for example, by helping students see how work builds on their prior knowledge.

                  <li>
                    <strong>See students:</strong>
                    In Fixer mode, teachers primarily see their students through the lens of the trauma students may have experienced. They seek to nurture students and emphasize their own caregiving role.

                    <strong>Foster agency:</strong>
                    Because teachers in Fixer mode take upon themselves the work of supporting their students’ improvement, developing student agency is not a highly ranked goal for them.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Model learning:</strong>
                    Teachers in Fixer mode are more focused on clearly telling students what to do than on modeling it for them.

                  When in Fixer mode, teachers lean on tips and tricks and view multiple strategies as a way to accommodate student preference. In this mode, teachers’ perception of their students as needing additional support and their emphasis on test performance lead to a range of strategies that prioritize memorization or correct execution of procedure alongside more conceptually sound strategies. Teachers in Fixer mode  encourage students to use the strategies that work best for each student and their individual preference, rarely making connections across strategies.

                  In Ms. Delacruz’s Fixer mental model, the teacher is at the center of the classroom, with individual connections to each student. Through these connections, the teacher can help give students love and encouragement to counter their negative life contexts. It’s the teacher’s job to put down lots of small steps for students to approach math content.

                  Being in Fixer mode puts teachers in the driver’s seat. Their adoption of new tools depends on their own experience with them, as they test-drive new activities or platforms for themselves. They look for tools that show students step-by-step how to do the work -- or reinforce the process the teacher has already led them through.

                  Ms. Delacruz heads to her binder. They’re starting a new unit next week, so she’ll pull the lessons and activities that she thinks are right for this class. This year’s class has a bit more of a gap with some math facts, so she’ll need to start with some basics. And she has some great games to bring in to help kids get fluent with those facts.

                <br><br>
                Teachers in Fixer mode talk about their classroom contexts as critical to their work. They want to create conditions that their students feel are safe and loving. In practice, this comes to life through one-to-one relationships with the teacher, rather than as an overall classroom culture.

                    <strong>Who prompts</strong>
                    are used less in Fixer mode than any other teacher mode, consistent with their desire to shoulder the brunt of the work on students' behalf rather than emphasizing the students' own responsibility.

                    <strong>When prompts</strong>
                    are far less present in Fixer mode; in this mode, the teacher’s goal is to get students to follow their lead, not for students to decide between different strategies on their own.

                    are used to help students remember procedure and are often tied to teacher tips and tricks. In Fixer mode, visual organization tools are focused on streamlining student work process and avoiding mistakes.

                  Teachers in this mode work dominantly with whole class instruction, with the teacher at the head of the room. Whole class configuration puts the teacher at the center of the work and enables them to manage the dynamics. This fits the Fixer mental model of teaching and learning, in which students need clear models for and incremental approaches to problem-solving. In whole class configuration, teachers are the hub of conversation.
                  <br><br>
                  When teachers are in Fixer mode, they may occasionally use small group or partner work, but they generally do not prioritize students' abilities to work with each other meaningfully. More often, these configurations are used as a way for teachers to interact individually with small groups of students.

                  With themselves at the hub of the room, teachers in this mode push ahead and keep up the momentum of the classroom. This can mean letting the bulk of the class work independently while these teachers pull small groups to catch up the students who aren’t at pace with the rest. With teachers in Fixer mode attending to each student individually, classroom management can be a challenge as other students seek attention.

                    In the Fixer mode classroom, interactions are teacher directed. Fixer mode puts teachers at the heart of the room and this is seen through each type of interaction.

                    The class is sharing answers to the activity they just completed. Ms. Delacruz calls on students one-by-one to share what they got on each problem. Ms. Delacruz peppers her students with encouragement so that they always know they’re doing great.

                  They see student outcomes as a reflection of their impact. Feedback is a low-risk situation for teachers in Fixer mode that reinforces Fixer beliefs and the Fixer mental model. When students succeed, it is evidence that the teacher has succeeded in their support of students’ improvement. When progress isn't made, teachers in this mode may default to assuming that students' circumstances or learning efforts are in need of improvement.

                    When in Fixer mode, teachers use a range of formal and informal assessments to gauge student progress and to inform how teachers shape their classes. Self-reports and pre-tests help teachers in Fixer mode know who needs additional support and time with the teacher. Infrequent diagnostics (e.g., MAP testing) give teachers in this mode the ability to track growth and to anticipate outcomes.

                        Y’all are getting sixty percent, I’m impressed! I thought it might be a little lower than that. Remember our goal is eighty percent. I heard somebody say, “Can we do that again?” so I’m thinking maybe we’ll take it again after I teach it, so we can see how we do better.

                    Ms. Delacruz loves looking at student performance data; it’s like her own report card. Her students just took the pre-unit assessment and did pretty great on it, so that gives her a boost of energy for what’s to come.
