            This site summarizes the insights of an observational learning program, conducted by our team of design researchers with the goal of facilitating the beginning of the co-design process by providing teams with contextual understanding of teachers, their practices, classrooms, and students. The framework and teacher modes on this site are the result of 63 one-on-one teacher interviews, 41 classroom observations, and 20 virtual classroom deep dives, conducted with 18 teachers (8 from one district, 7 from a second district, and 3 from a third district) over the 2019-20 school year. We hope that this site helps co-design teams to think about multiple perspectives and engage in further conversation about the classrooms of teachers.

                <h2>Cycle of Practice</h2>
                <p>
                  This summary is organized in a framework called the Cycle of Practice. The Cycle describes one model of the beliefs, knowledge, and actions of teachers in a six stage loop that follows how teacher mindsets and identities come to life in classroom behaviors. This framework is meant to provide co-design teams with insights and discussion prompts to guide their design and development efforts. We hope that co-design teams can use the Cycle framework to consider how prototype learning systems resonate with teacher mindsets and how features can best support teacher practices. For example, a team might brainstorm on a specific stage within the Cycle, digging deep into this aspect of teacher practice to imagine ways that their solution can meet the needs of a range or teachers and reflect the values that they have.

              <h2>Teacher Modes</h2>
              <p>
                We also found four teacher modes in our learnings from our district partners. Each teacher mode embodies a unique approach to the Cycle of Practice. Each teacher mode reveals a different set of teacher beliefs and reveals how these beliefs come to life in classrooms. Each mode is a composite of the teachers collaborated with throughout this learning project, a flexible set of descriptors that are meant to inspire new thinking (not put teachers into categories). We hope that these teacher modes can spark new ideas in the co-design teams and act as filters as teams iterate solutions. For example, teams can ideate functions, features or design attributes for each teacher mode. An exercise like this will help a team to push the edges of their solution, exploring potential barriers to adoption and imagining how the solution will be considered and used by different teachers in different modes. We have included a downloadable resource with some prompting questions at the end of each teacher mode that we hope can support teams in this work.

              <h2>Executive Functions</h2>
              <p>
                It’s worth noting that, though EFs are central to this program, the teachers we interviewed did not discuss EFs by name without prompting. When discussing EFs through our prompts, differences were noted in how teachers discussed EFs and the ways researchers discuss EFs.  This, of course, is the opportunity that this program is addressing.
                <br><br>
                Generally, when asked about EFs, teachers described student emotions, behaviors, and social emotional learning. Teachers discussed working memory in connection to student prior knowledge, recall, muscle memory, and tools such as student notebooks and notes. Teachers discussed cognitive flexibility as related to students’ use of different math strategies or approaches, student ownership of learning, and student problem solving. Inhibitory control was described by teachers through the lens of student behavior, independence, perseverance, self-efficacy, and relationships with peers.
                <br><br>
                Because our goal in this site is to bring forward teacher mindsets and contexts, we use this teacher-driven language throughout.

              <h2>Equity</h2>
              <p>
                Similarly, throughout the site we strive to frame teachers’ equity approaches and practices in their own language and mindsets.
                <br><br>
                Teachers discussed how inequities impact the contexts of their classroom and their students’ lives. Teachers were most likely to talk about challenges related to poverty and said that these could be barriers for learning, for example, if a student was coming in hungry or preoccupied with family stress. They also spoke about how their English language learning students were impacted in their ability to access content; for example, struggles with word problems were a common theme.
                <br><br>
                Some teachers explicitly enacted tools and structures to support equity in their classrooms. The most commonly seen were methods to ensure that calling on students to speak was randomized and evenly distributed. Teachers’ approaches to small group and individual work also emphasized students who most needed the additional support based on their current performance.
                <br><br>
                We hope this document serves as a starting point to further discussions among co-design teams about how equity can inform classroom practices.

                  Finally, this program and the classrooms studied were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are additional insights revealing how the Cycle of Practice was impacted by remote learning. We interviewed teachers at the beginning of Summer 2020 about their experiences from the mid-March closure through the end of the school year. These interviews all took place before teachers were preparing for the 2020-21 school year.

            This observational learning program was conducted by our team of design researchers to provide insight into the contexts of math classrooms and the mindsets and behaviors of teachers.
            <br><br>
            Design research is a generative approach to learning about what the world looks like through the eyes of users. It’s focused on setting aside preconceptions so that we can listen closely, look anew, and gain empathy. Design research surfaces insights about what people value, aspire to, and perceive, as well as what they experience, are challenged by, and need. Its goal is to identify actionable insights and opportunities for design.

              The program was disrupted, as so many things, by the COVID-19 pandemic, so methods shifted midway. Teachers were asked to participate in individual interviews and either classroom observations or lesson deep dives.
              <br><br>
              For the teachers that we visited in person, we conducted our interviews in person, in their classrooms, perched in kid-sized chairs. We observed their classes directly, as well as their team meetings, and interviewed the math leaders in their schools.
              <br><br>
              For the teachers we met after the pandemic set in, we met virtually. Interviews were conducted by video conference and in lieu of classroom observations, we conducted lesson deep dives, in which teachers replayed a lesson for us.

              Interviews were shaped around the following topics (across either two (pandemic) or three (pre-pandemic) interviews). The goal of the interviews was to understand teachers’ perspectives, experiences, and contexts to provide opportunities for the R&D teams to co-design solutions that reflect these values, needs, and realities.
              <br><br>
              Our team designed our interview topics around a model developed to apply research on behavior change to design opportunities. This model was developed based on a review of literature around adherence and behavior change in the psychology, medicine, and nursing practices, including influential work such as the research of James Prochaska and Robin DiMatteo. These findings from academic research were combined with best practices from designers working in the behavior change space to create a set of tools that are both theoretically rigorous and also useful, usable, and desirable for the practice of designing interventions.

              To ground the observations in sound math instruction, our team was normed on key practices (a crosswalk of NCTM Principles to Action (2014) and Teaching for Robust Understanding (Schoenfeld, 2014)). Our goal was not to evaluate teachers, but to center our observations on barriers and enablers of critical practices.
              <br><br>
              Classroom observations were shaped around a common design thinking framework, in which the design researchers observed for the following areas. This framework allows design researchers to focus attention on critical elements of the context, with the goal of identifying design opportunities.

              Lesson deep dives in the virtual setting were not able to replicate the experience of being in classrooms as learning was happening, but we sought to investigate the areas of highest relevance, based on analysis of the direct observations. We asked teachers to pick one pre-pandemic lesson for each deep dive and to walk us through the lesson as it rolled out.

            <p class="small-12 cell">
              Our team worked in pairs to interview and observe teachers and coded this data (interview notes, video and audio recordings) as teams. Designers coded the data for areas of interest independently and then met to align on any areas of disagreement (there were few). Group analysis surfaced themes within and across these initial areas of interest, which became the key factors highlighted in the final site.
              <br><br>
              We returned to the model of adherence and behavior change to structure our analysis, aligning key factors to the stages of this model to create the Cycle of Practice framework.
              <br><br>
              To bring this framework to life and to contextualize how it unfurls for different types of teachers, we then analyzed participants to identify clusters of beliefs and practices. Key factors were articulated for each of the teachers who we learned from. For factors drawn from teachers’ self-reporting, the team ranked teachers high/medium/low against a common rubric so that trends could be identified. For factors related to observable behaviors, these were coded for each participant. The team worked together to look across factors, across participants, identifying teacher modes that interacted with the framework in distinct ways.

              <p>
                Teachers in Facilitator mode are highly attendant to the challenges their students have before they enter the classroom. They see math as a subject that can be challenging to some -- intimidating to many students and sometimes even themselves -- and want to set the stage for students to engage on their own terms. Facilitators emphasize a student-centered classroom, wanting to create spaces where students feel they have choice and a range of access points to content.
                <br><br>
                In Facilitator mode, teachers are attuned to their students’ social emotional lives, but take a hands-off approach to this side of their students. They don’t want to push too hard, as it can make things worse or stir up issues that these teachers don’t feel it is their place to manage. Teachers in Facilitator mode believe the best approach is to create a setting that fully accommodates students so that they can do their work.

                  Math was hard for Mx. Alex Sun, so they totally get why it’s challenging for their students too. It wasn’t until they had a teacher in fifth grade who helped them love learning that they felt like they could be confident in their math learning.
                  <br><br>
                  Mx. Sun often finds themself in the Facilitator mode. Their students have so much going on in their lives, and Mx. Sun feels that math can be intimidating and overwhelming to kids who already feel like the world isn’t on their side. So they try to make math something that kids can feel safe with and maybe even have fun with! Mx. Sun tries to teach their students that the students can handle this, and gives them lots of space to approach the work in the way that’s best for the students.

                    In Facilitator mode, teachers’ most strongly framed goal is student independence. Independence is defined behaviorally and is echoed in classroom approaches. These teachers want their students to be able to operate smoothly in the classroom, taking responsibility for themselves in the room so that student voice and choice can be implemented.

                  <li>
                    <span class="is-bold">Math-related: </span>
                    Teachers in Facilitator mode want their students to feel safe and confident with math, comfortable approaching the work. This goal doesn’t necessarily extend to mastery of the material.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="is-bold">Life readiness: </span>
                    Similarly, life-related goals for teachers in this mode are not grounded in math, but in a general desire for their students to do well.

                <p>
                  Mx. Sun sticks with the curriculum. It’s pretty detailed and lays out the learning objectives and activities for them. They make sure they review in advance, and think through some of the questions they think their students might ask. For tomorrow, they’re adding in an activity to show students how much they’ve all learned. It’s the same questions as the usual worksheet, but, because this class really loves video games, Mx. Sun found a version that’s all about gaming.

              <p>
                In their effort to create safety and to allow their students’ gentle on-ramps into math learning, they prioritize activities that are high in entertainment value or in student choice. In Facilitator mode, teachers try to shape their classrooms around student preferences and voice, for example, surveying students on their preferred learning methods or co-creating community agreements together.

                    <strong>Who prompts</strong>
                    are most often used by teachers in Facilitator mode in one-on-one settings to encourage students.
                    <li>
                      <strong>When prompts</strong>
                      are rarely deployed by teachers in Facilitator mode because the bulk of the work of examining strategies falls to the students.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Why prompts</strong>
                      are used less by teachers in Facilitator mode than any other teacher mode, embodying these teachers’ tendency to keep away from engaging students in conceptual exploration.

                      <strong>Where prompts</strong>

                    <li>
                      <strong>What prompts</strong>
                      are used frequently by teachers in Facilitator mode, often with the teacher breaking down micro-steps within a problem.

                      <strong>How prompts</strong>
                      are used by teachers in Facilitator mode to build class understanding of process and the use of algorithms.

Students are sprawled across the room, some on the bean bag chairs in the corner, some on a soft rug, some sitting at the dining room table and chairs Mx. Sun picked up off Craigslist. Letting them choose is a way to give the students control.

                    They tend to prefer to stick with the plan, even when things don’t go as expected. If they regroup or reteach, it’s not until they’ve had the chance to carefully think through and digest what happened, and figure out what to do next. Because they prefer to distance themselves from their students’ life challenges, Facilitators aren’t always tuned into reading the room, except for heated behavioral moments that they seek to resolve swiftly to maintain a safe and calm classroom.

                    Because teachers in Facilitator mode see math as a possibly tough subject and success as their students’ apparent ability to engage with the content, they look for feedback around engagement.

                    In this mode, teachers are reinforced when they see their students putting in the effort, whether that is putting pencil to paper or taking what they see as a reasonable amount of time to do the work.

                      Teachers in facilitator mode see tests primarily as stressful for their students. Teachers in this mode de-emphasize routine assessments like exit tickets, cutting down the number of problems they need students to answer for them to have a window on student understanding, and reassuring their students that assessments are a reflection of the teacher’s work as much as the students’.
                      <br><br>
                      In Facilitator mode, teachers use feedback from assessments to inform their need to reteach. They look for right or wrong answers and where students’ process might need redirection to understand who needs additional help and what to reteach.

                          It’s stressful for the kids, there are so many tests; it seems like they spend the first few weeks of school with assessments. I tell them that the assessments will help me be a better teacher. What they do on the test doesn’t necessarily show what they are capable of and what they know.

                      Mx. Sun knows their students are nervous about today’s test. As everyone comes in the door, Mx. Sun makes sure the kids know that this test is to help them be a better teacher. Whether the students do OK or do poorly, it doesn’t mean that all of them aren’t great people. Mx. Sun certainly must have failed tests as a kid! And look at Mx. Sun now, they turned out OK.
