            This site summarizes the insights of an observational learning program, conducted by our team of design researchers with the goal of facilitating the beginning of the co-design process by providing teams with contextual understanding of teachers, their practices, classrooms, and students. The framework and teacher modes on this site are the result of 63 one-on-one teacher interviews, 41 classroom observations, and 20 virtual classroom deep dives, conducted with 18 teachers (8 from one district, 7 from a second district, and 3 from a third district) over the 2019-20 school year. We hope that this site helps co-design teams to think about multiple perspectives and engage in further conversation about the classrooms of teachers.

                <h2>Cycle of Practice</h2>
                <p>
                  This summary is organized in a framework called the Cycle of Practice. The Cycle describes one model of the beliefs, knowledge, and actions of teachers in a six stage loop that follows how teacher mindsets and identities come to life in classroom behaviors. This framework is meant to provide co-design teams with insights and discussion prompts to guide their design and development efforts. We hope that co-design teams can use the Cycle framework to consider how prototype learning systems resonate with teacher mindsets and how features can best support teacher practices. For example, a team might brainstorm on a specific stage within the Cycle, digging deep into this aspect of teacher practice to imagine ways that their solution can meet the needs of a range or teachers and reflect the values that they have.

              <h2>Teacher Modes</h2>
              <p>
                We also found four teacher modes in our learnings from our district partners. Each teacher mode embodies a unique approach to the Cycle of Practice. Each teacher mode reveals a different set of teacher beliefs and reveals how these beliefs come to life in classrooms. Each mode is a composite of the teachers collaborated with throughout this learning project, a flexible set of descriptors that are meant to inspire new thinking (not put teachers into categories). We hope that these teacher modes can spark new ideas in the co-design teams and act as filters as teams iterate solutions. For example, teams can ideate functions, features or design attributes for each teacher mode. An exercise like this will help a team to push the edges of their solution, exploring potential barriers to adoption and imagining how the solution will be considered and used by different teachers in different modes. We have included a downloadable resource with some prompting questions at the end of each teacher mode that we hope can support teams in this work.

              <h2>Executive Functions</h2>
              <p>
                It’s worth noting that, though EFs are central to this program, the teachers we interviewed did not discuss EFs by name without prompting. When discussing EFs through our prompts, differences were noted in how teachers discussed EFs and the ways researchers discuss EFs.  This, of course, is the opportunity that this program is addressing.
                <br><br>
                Generally, when asked about EFs, teachers described student emotions, behaviors, and social emotional learning. Teachers discussed working memory in connection to student prior knowledge, recall, muscle memory, and tools such as student notebooks and notes. Teachers discussed cognitive flexibility as related to students’ use of different math strategies or approaches, student ownership of learning, and student problem solving. Inhibitory control was described by teachers through the lens of student behavior, independence, perseverance, self-efficacy, and relationships with peers.
                <br><br>
                Because our goal in this site is to bring forward teacher mindsets and contexts, we use this teacher-driven language throughout.

              <h2>Equity</h2>
              <p>
                Similarly, throughout the site we strive to frame teachers’ equity approaches and practices in their own language and mindsets.
                <br><br>
                Teachers discussed how inequities impact the contexts of their classroom and their students’ lives. Teachers were most likely to talk about challenges related to poverty and said that these could be barriers for learning, for example, if a student was coming in hungry or preoccupied with family stress. They also spoke about how their English language learning students were impacted in their ability to access content; for example, struggles with word problems were a common theme.
                <br><br>
                Some teachers explicitly enacted tools and structures to support equity in their classrooms. The most commonly seen were methods to ensure that calling on students to speak was randomized and evenly distributed. Teachers’ approaches to small group and individual work also emphasized students who most needed the additional support based on their current performance.
                <br><br>
                We hope this document serves as a starting point to further discussions among co-design teams about how equity can inform classroom practices.

                  Finally, this program and the classrooms studied were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are additional insights revealing how the Cycle of Practice was impacted by remote learning. We interviewed teachers at the beginning of Summer 2020 about their experiences from the mid-March closure through the end of the school year. These interviews all took place before teachers were preparing for the 2020-21 school year.

            This observational learning program was conducted by our team of design researchers to provide insight into the contexts of math classrooms and the mindsets and behaviors of teachers.
            <br><br>
            Design research is a generative approach to learning about what the world looks like through the eyes of users. It’s focused on setting aside preconceptions so that we can listen closely, look anew, and gain empathy. Design research surfaces insights about what people value, aspire to, and perceive, as well as what they experience, are challenged by, and need. Its goal is to identify actionable insights and opportunities for design.

              The program was disrupted, as so many things, by the COVID-19 pandemic, so methods shifted midway. Teachers were asked to participate in individual interviews and either classroom observations or lesson deep dives.
              <br><br>
              For the teachers that we visited in person, we conducted our interviews in person, in their classrooms, perched in kid-sized chairs. We observed their classes directly, as well as their team meetings, and interviewed the math leaders in their schools.
              <br><br>
              For the teachers we met after the pandemic set in, we met virtually. Interviews were conducted by video conference and in lieu of classroom observations, we conducted lesson deep dives, in which teachers replayed a lesson for us.

              Interviews were shaped around the following topics (across either two (pandemic) or three (pre-pandemic) interviews). The goal of the interviews was to understand teachers’ perspectives, experiences, and contexts to provide opportunities for the R&D teams to co-design solutions that reflect these values, needs, and realities.
              <br><br>
              Our team designed our interview topics around a model developed to apply research on behavior change to design opportunities. This model was developed based on a review of literature around adherence and behavior change in the psychology, medicine, and nursing practices, including influential work such as the research of James Prochaska and Robin DiMatteo. These findings from academic research were combined with best practices from designers working in the behavior change space to create a set of tools that are both theoretically rigorous and also useful, usable, and desirable for the practice of designing interventions.

              To ground the observations in sound math instruction, our team was normed on key practices (a crosswalk of NCTM Principles to Action (2014) and Teaching for Robust Understanding (Schoenfeld, 2014)). Our goal was not to evaluate teachers, but to center our observations on barriers and enablers of critical practices.
              <br><br>
              Classroom observations were shaped around a common design thinking framework, in which the design researchers observed for the following areas. This framework allows design researchers to focus attention on critical elements of the context, with the goal of identifying design opportunities.

              Lesson deep dives in the virtual setting were not able to replicate the experience of being in classrooms as learning was happening, but we sought to investigate the areas of highest relevance, based on analysis of the direct observations. We asked teachers to pick one pre-pandemic lesson for each deep dive and to walk us through the lesson as it rolled out.

              Our team worked in pairs to interview and observe teachers and coded this data (interview notes, video and audio recordings) as teams. Designers coded the data for areas of interest independently and then met to align on any areas of disagreement (there were few). Group analysis surfaced themes within and across these initial areas of interest, which became the key factors highlighted in the final site.
              <br><br>
              We returned to the model of adherence and behavior change to structure our analysis, aligning key factors to the stages of this model to create the Cycle of Practice framework.
              <br><br>
              To bring this framework to life and to contextualize how it unfurls for different types of teachers, we then analyzed participants to identify clusters of beliefs and practices. Key factors were articulated for each of the teachers who we learned from. For factors drawn from teachers’ self-reporting, the team ranked teachers high/medium/low against a common rubric so that trends could be identified. For factors related to observable behaviors, these were coded for each participant. The team worked together to look across factors, across participants, identifying teacher modes that interacted with the framework in distinct ways.

              <p>
                Teachers were interviewed again in early summer 2020 about their experiences with remote learning in the spring. The themes here don’t reflect planning or approaches to the 2020-21 school year.
                <br><br>
                The abrupt switch to remote learning was universally problematic for teachers and their students. It challenged teachers’ conceptions of their own work and effectiveness and disrupted the roles that they value for themselves. The transition was traumatic and uncertain, sticking clearly in peoples’ minds like those blue skies on September 11th. The move to remote learning was messy, disheartening, and disruptive to each phase in their Cycle of Practice.

                  The measure of their work became about engagement and participation rather than academics, with the goal of staying connected with students and families. Teachers said that any work was good work, delighted to receive proof of effort even when the caliber was far below what they would expect under normal circumstances.
                  <br><br>
                  And even this was challenging. Student participation felt low and sporadic. Teachers anecdotally described their students falling into the following types of engagement.

                    <strong>Consistent participation:</strong>
                    most teachers said there were a handful of students who they could count on to show up for meetings and/or to complete all the assigned work. This was on the order of 20-30% of their class (these numbers are estimates).

                  <li>
                    <strong>Sporadic participation:</strong>
                    the bulk of the class would participate sporadically, jumping in some days or weeks and then falling off the radar. This was on the order of half the class based on teacher recollections.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>No participation:</strong>
                    finally, there were students who didn’t participate at all and who teachers may not have been able to reach at all during remote learning. This was on the order of 20-30%, according to teacher estimates.

                  Participation itself was varied, from students who’d show up, do the work and reflect  effort, to students who would only log on to meetings, to students who’d attempt work but with low apparent effort (though teachers noted that family/home circumstances made it difficult to judge true interest/effort/accessibility).

Teachers absorbed the burden of worrying about (and supporting) the health and wellness of their students and, at times, their families.

                  In normal times, teachers talk about the challenges in students’ lives that impact their work in the classroom. During remote learning, the classroom was coming into students’ home contexts. This posed profound challenges for teachers and students.
                  <br><br>
                  Remote learning required a degree of independence from students that teachers did not see as reasonable for some students. It asked students to balance learning with home responsibilities, such as caring for siblings. And many teachers said that learning was more reliant on parents’ ability to support students at home.

                  These new contexts and roles meant that teachers weren’t able to teach as they normally do. The roles and moves that are typically their foundations were thrown into question and the activities supported by remote learning were faint echoes of their usual teacher selves. Some teachers told stories of Hail Mary activities or bright spot projects they designed -- heroic efforts that, at least, made them feel like they’d given it their all.

                As teachers describe remote learning, there was no blueprint, no model of success. There still isn’t. They were left with few supports and a great deal of ambiguity about what “good” meant in this context.

                  Not surprisingly, district guidance was inconsistent. Transitions were tough. School closures were announced without clear guidance for teachers available. As spring break 2020 came and went, districts got their feet beneath them and were able to offer more coherent direction to teachers.

                  Even the best district guidance, however, was not enough to level up teachers and equip them for this challenge within the tight timeframe of the Spring shutdown. Teachers expressed that directives generally focused on staying engaged and ensuring equitable experiences rather than rigorous academics and that district models, when they existed, required customization for their classes.

                  Teachers believe that a key challenge in keeping students and their families invested in education was the fact that districts announced early that families and students would not be held responsible for schoolwork during remote learning. Districts announced that students wouldn’t be held accountable for remote learning, and teachers reflected a narrow range of approaches to what this looked like, from an end of year pass/fail (in which everyone passed), to grading only up to March, to no grades but short descriptions of the student’s work.

                  Remote learning disrupted teacher routines, often resulting in an ambient always-working mode. Teachers were able to plan and structure their own work, creating assignments, recording videos, and posting them at routine times. But they weren’t able to anticipate when students and families would need their attention, with students turning things in from morning to night and many teachers feeling like their quick feedback was a way to show care and connection.
                  <br><br>
                  Some teachers were thrown into isolation by remote learning, while others continued to plan as a team. Teamwork could be helpful, when it allowed teachers to play to their strengths and divvy up work; or, it could add burden, when one teacher had more tech capabilities or fewer other at-home responsibilities than their teammates.

                  Technology and connectivity access was a barrier throughout. Even as districts scrambled to get tech into each family’s hands, access was not equal. Some families shared a computer across multiple family members, some had students working from tablets or phones, some families (and teachers) had spotty to no wifi.
                  <br><br>
                  Even with tech in hand, there was a considerable learning curve to get students and families comfortable on the range of platforms, as teachers simultaneously experimented with what would work best for them and their students. Teachers were tech-support in many cases, making how-to videos or hopping on calls to walk frustrated families through the process.
                  <br><br>
                  In this uneven, inequitable landscape, guidance was to set a baseline that was not tech-dependent so that there could be equitable access. For some teachers, this meant they were getting direction not to offer any synchronous learning that relied on technology. For some, it meant they needed to offer options, so that students could participate through a range of channels.

                  Teachers keenly felt the loss of connection with their students and their classroom community. Remote learning damaged the culture of the classroom, as teachers described students as being on islands on their own. For both teachers and students, the ability to connect directly was lost, mimicked in comment boards or social Zoom calls. Teachers described the missing element as the in-the-moment ability to connect, to be able to gauge how a student is, to give a hug or a high five, or to peek over a shoulder to see how the work is going.

Many schools directed teachers to hold information until the last minute so as not to add to students’ concerns and confusion and to ensure the most up-to-the-moment facts were presented; teachers reflected regrets that they didn’t get to better prepare students for remote learning tools, expectations, and routines.
                  <br><br>
                  Students working independently in their own contexts meant that teachers lost the ability to manage how they structured their time and work, and the mindsets teachers attempt to set in the classroom to motivate students to learn. Teachers also expressed how challenging it was not to be able to see what their students were doing, losing the ability to course-correct in real time or to enable students to build off each others’ thinking.
                  <br><br>
                  Perhaps most acute was the loss of the ability to teach the way they love to. Remote learning made some teachers say they had reverted to direct instruction and procedural practice, losing the ability to foster student conversation, collaboration, and responsiveness to a range of ideas and methods.

                      I much prefer the classroom in terms of academics because I can hold them accountable. I can’t do this! I have no control over ‘you’re going to sit there and you have to do this.’ I hated it. I hated that part of remote learning.

                In some ways, remote learning put teachers into hyper-adaptive mode, as they hustled to get wholly new ways of teaching and learning up and running. In other ways, it hampered their ability to respond and react to their students.

                  Throughout remote learning, teachers were iterating on platforms, tools and assignments to figure out what worked best for them and their students. They were adjusting district recommendations to their own students and classrooms and trying a range of formats to see what students would respond to and what would work across technology and analog modes. Teachers would see where they got more or less engagement and where students and families were challenged by the technology as input for adaptation.

                      As a teacher, we teach, that’s our job. But it’s hard to keep giving out and not getting that return. You’re doing all that work and you only have 5-8 kids coming and those are the ones who don’t need your help.

                  Most essentially, teachers were stripped of the flow of student work that they are accustomed to. Challenged by the struggles of remote learning, students were accomplishing much less work, not turning anything in, or doing so only occasionally. As a result, teachers were given only a patchy view of their students’ understanding and progress.
                  <br><br>
                  Moreover, the work that students were turning in was at a lower caliber than teachers were used to. Students weren’t necessarily aware of their gaps and teachers had a tough time making sure that feedback or corrections were landing with them to course correct misconceptions.
                  <br><br>
                  The mechanics of work could be a barrier as well. Blurry phone pics of a worksheet were difficult to read and impossible to offer meaningful feedback on.

                      My ability to give feedback was totally destroyed. In the normal classroom, I  feel like I have a real solid idea of the handful of kids I need to check in with tomorrow or the kids having the interesting conversation to dive deeper into tomorrow.

                      The return is students doing the work. It was hard not to see assignments being turned in. And the quality of the work [was low]! What’s going on, why can’t they do it on their own? It makes you reflect back on you.

                  Some teachers found or made their own bright spots. Online platforms offered unique opportunities for differentiation without students being sensitized to it. For example, teachers could assign work individually without students comparing with peers.

                  And moments that reinforced relationships and the classroom community shone, such as end-of-year share outs that reflected classroom values, birthday cards between students, or even moments of affection in a Zoom chat.
